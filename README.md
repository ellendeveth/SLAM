# SLAM

SLAM is a web application where non-profit organizations are able to post projects they want to realize, but lack funding to do so.
Students with the corresponding skills can sign up for projects and thus help these organizations achieve more goals.
Service learning is the educational approach that SLAM focusses on, creating an added value for our society.
